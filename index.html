<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

<ol>
  <li> HTML is cool </li>
  <li> CSS is cooler </li>
  <li> JS is the best</li>

<h16> What do you need to create a website? </h16>

Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
